# Introduction

Welcome to the web management school platform - SekolahKu!

This platform is designed to improve communication and organization within the school community by providing a central location for all relevant information and resources.

Students will be able to access their class schedules, submit assignments, and view their grades. Teachers will be able to post announcements, create and distribute assignments, and enter grades. Parents will be able to view their child's progress and communicate with teachers.

We hope that this platform will make it easier for everyone to stay informed and on track, and we encourage all members of the school community to use it to its full potential

There are several problems that the web management school platform aims to solve:

1. Communication breakdown: It can be difficult for teachers, students, and parents to stay in touch and stay informed about what's happening in the school. This platform provides a centralized location for announcements, class schedules, and other important information, making it easier for everyone to stay up to date.

2. Lack of organization: It can be challenging for students to keep track of assignments, class schedules, and other tasks. The platform allows students to view their schedules and submit assignments, helping them stay organized and on top of their responsibilities.

3. Parental involvement: It can be difficult for parents to stay involved in their child's education, especially if they have busy schedules or if the school is not able to provide regular updates. The platform allows parents to view their child's progress and communicate with teachers, helping them stay connected to their child's education.

Overall, the web management school platform helps to solve these problems by providing a convenient and user-friendly platform that brings everyone in the school community together and helps everyone stay informed and organized.
